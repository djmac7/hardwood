"""Canonical college names.

Basketball-Reference gives the college field as a single free-text string that
packs a player's whole school history into one comma-separated run:

    "Blinn College, Brown Mackie College, Houston"

which is unparseable as-is and inconsistently styled ("Jackson State University"
next to "Alcorn State"). normalize() turns that into a clean list plus a single
primary school.

Two things make this less trivial than a str.split(","):

1. Some school names contain a comma ("University of California, Irvine").
   Those are protected before the split and restored after — see _PROTECTED.
2. The trailing "University"/"College" is usually noise, but for a handful of
   names it *is* the school: Boston College and Boston University are different
   institutions. _KEEP_SUFFIX lists every such collision found in the data.

Primary school = the LAST one listed, which is the one the player left for the
NBA and the one draft coverage credits them to.
