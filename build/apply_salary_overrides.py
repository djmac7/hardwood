"""
Restore the source-verified salary corrections after a rebuild.

build/fetch_salaries.py rebuilds data/salaries.json from public open CSVs. Some of
those CSVs are inflation-adjusted (not nominal) for 2017-18 and 2020-21..2023-24, which
once inflated star salaries ~20%. Rather than trust the CSVs for those seasons, we freeze
the reconciled-against-Basketball-Reference values in build/salary-overrides.json and
re-apply them here, then recompute the derived structures. fetch_salaries.py calls this as
its last step, so re-running the pipeline can no longer re-introduce the inflation.

Overrides are keyed  pid -> { "season": value }  where value is either:
  - a number            → correct the salary amount only, or
  - {"s": salary, "t": abbr} → also RE-ATTRIBUTE the season to team `abbr`.

The team form fixes "dead money" mis-attribution: a bought-out veteran's full guaranteed
salary is carried by the team that waived him, but the raw pipeline files it under the
minimum-salary team he later signed with (e.g. Kemba Walker's $37.3M 2022-23 landing on the
Mavericks, where he played 9 games on a minimum). Re-attributing to the waiving team keeps
his career-earnings total intact while fixing the team-payroll pages.
