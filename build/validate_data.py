Pre-deploy data-integrity gate for Hardwood.

Accuracy is the product. This script hard-fails (exit 1) on the classes of
corruption that have actually bitten us — a game with a score but an empty box
score, salaries silently re-inflated by an upstream refresh, box scores whose
player points don't add up — while only WARNING on known, benign historical
quirks (pre-1974 games never recorded FG attempts; some preseason lines are
partial). Run it before committing a data refresh:

    python3 build/validate_data.py            # 0 = clean, 1 = blocking errors

refresh.sh calls this and aborts the commit if it fails.
