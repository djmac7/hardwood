"""
Add per-season rosters to each data/team/<abbr>.json.

The team files ship a single `roster` (the latest season — refreshed live from ESPN for
active teams). Historical season views (#/team/CLE/2025) had no season-specific roster, so
they showed the latest roster mislabelled. This backfills `rostersBySeason` for every PAST
season from the shipped player logs, which are stint-accurate (a traded player appears on
each team he actually played for, never the combined 2TM line) — matching the roster
convention the rest of the site uses.

Reads only already-published data (data/player/*.json + data/team/*.json), so it runs
without the raw Kaggle CSVs. Idempotent: re-run any time after a player-data rebuild.

log row layout (see build_data.py):
  [0 season, 1 lg, 2 team, 3 age, 4 g, 5 mp, 6 fg%, 7 3p%, 8 ft%,
   9 trb, 10 ast, 11 stl, 12 blk, 13 pts, 14 per, 15 ts%, 16 stint_flag]
roster row (matches the live `roster` shape): [id, name, pos, g, pts, reb, ast]
