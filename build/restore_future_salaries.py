"""Re-attach FULL future contract years (seasons > current) after a fetch_salaries.py rebuild.

fetch_salaries.py rebuilds salaries.json from the open source CSVs, which only run through the
current season — so a rebuild drops the guaranteed future contract years (2027+) that were added
separately. Those years originate from HoopsHype's team pages via patch_future_salaries.py, but
HoopsHype's robots.txt now disallows automated access, so we do NOT re-fetch them here. Instead we
carry the already-published future rows forward from the last committed salaries.json (git HEAD),
which is where patch_future_salaries.py deposited them.

Idempotent: only ADDS seasons a player doesn't already have; existing rows and careerEarn are left
untouched. Recomputes range + teamPayroll/payrollRank for the restored future seasons.

Run order:  fetch_salaries.py  ->  (fix_salary_teams, apply_salary_overrides run inside it)  ->
            restore_future_salaries.py  ->  build_seo.py
To genuinely refresh future contracts from source, run patch_future_salaries.py in an environment
permitted to access HoopsHype, then commit — this script will carry that snapshot forward after.
