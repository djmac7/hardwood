"""Bake season-accurate jersey numbers into team rosters (roster + rostersBySeason).

Appends the number a player wore that season for that franchise as index 7 of each roster
entry [pid, name, pos, gp, pts, reb, ast, num]. Source: build/jersey_by_season.json
(pid -> "season|abbr" -> num), harvested from BBR. Idempotent; re-run after the team files
are rebuilt. Numbers surface on the team page's roster tables."""
