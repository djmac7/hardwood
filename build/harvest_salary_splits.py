"""
Turn cached Basketball-Reference player salary tables into build/salary-splits.json.

Provenance / one-time harvest: BBR player pages are fetched separately (respecting the 3s
crawl-delay) into a cache dir, one JSON per player of [ [season,"Team Name",amount], ... ].
This reads that cache + our current data and emits two kinds of correction:

  * dead-money split — a season our data files under ONE team but BBR shows split across
    several, where our attributed team's real (BBR) share is < half the total. The player was
    bought out and signed a minimum elsewhere; we replace the single row with BBR's exact
    per-team figures so no min-signing shows as a team's top earner.
  * 2025-26 fill — a player who logged 2025-26 minutes but has no salary yet; add BBR's figure.

Output format (consumed by apply_salary_splits.py):  {pid: {season: [[abbr, amount], ...]}}
