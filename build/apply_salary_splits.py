"""
Apply Basketball-Reference-verified per-team salary splits + current-season fills.

Two problems this fixes, both sourced from BBR player pages (build/salary-splits.json):

1. Dead-money mis-attribution. A bought-out veteran's full guaranteed salary was filed under
   the minimum-salary team he later signed with (Kemba Walker's $37.3M 2022-23 landing on the
   Mavericks). BBR itemises the real per-team split — the small figure the playing team actually
   paid, plus the dead money owed by the team(s) that waived him — so team-payroll pages become
   exact and no min-signing shows up as a top earner.

2. Current-season gaps. The open CSVs stop at 2024-25, leaving 2025-26 (season 2026) with only a
   partial top-up. BBR player pages carry the completed 2025-26 figure, added here.

Format:  {pid: {season: [[teamAbbr, amount], ...]}}  — a season's list REPLACES that player's
bySeason rows for the season; byPlayer[season] becomes the sum (career-earnings total intact).

Run order: … apply_salary_overrides → restore_future_salaries → apply_salary_splits (last;
it recomputes every derived structure from the final byPlayer / bySeason).
