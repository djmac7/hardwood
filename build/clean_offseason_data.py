"""One-off reconciliation for the current offseason snapshot. Safe to re-run.

(1) Teams: set each player's cur.team from the current ESPN roster they appear on
    (data/team/*.json rosters are refreshed by fetch_live.rosters(), which reflects
    offseason trades — but it never wrote the new team back to the player files, so
    a traded player's masthead still showed his last on-court team, e.g. AD on DAL).

(2) Injuries: rewrite data/injuries.json to keep only players genuinely sidelined by
    injury. In the offseason ESPN's /injuries feed is mostly transaction/draft/rest
    news defaulted to "Day-To-Day"; those notes have nothing to do with an injury.
    We keep only entries whose note describes a real injury, normalise the status to
    "Out", and attach a short injury type.

The classification helpers here are mirrored in build/fetch_live.py so scheduled
refreshes stay clean.
